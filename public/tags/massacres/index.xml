      <description>Munsee converts from Pennsylvania follow Moravian missionary David Zeisberger to eastern Ohio, where he founds several Native Moravian villages. The British arrest him during the Revolutionary War under suspicion of helping the Patriots. While under arrest at Fort Detroit, nearly one hundred of his Native American followers are murdered in what is memorialized as the Gnadenhutten Massacre. This leads to the Moravian Delaware migration.

      <description>Munsee-speaking clans live in communities on ancestral lands across the northeast New Jersey-New York border. Nearby Dutch from New Amsterdam attack and kill approximately 700 Native people in what becomes known as the Pound Ridge Massacre in effort to force out these communities.
