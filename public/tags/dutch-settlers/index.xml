      <description>In 1624, the Dutch colonize the southern tip of Manhattan Island and establish a trading post, which becomes New Amsterdam, and later, New York City. The fur trade booms. Manhattan, or Mannahatta, is a Munsee Lunaape word for the “bow-gathering place.”

      <description>Dutch explorers establish trade with Lunaapeew in the early 1610s and then build settlements on both sides of Lenapewihittuck (the Delaware) in the 1620s. Lunaape homelands are increasingly populated with Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English settlers. They use Lunaape trails to explore the land and transport resources. They also introduce diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza that would devastate many Indigenous nations.

      <description>Munsee-speaking clans live in communities on ancestral lands across the northeast New Jersey-New York border. Nearby Dutch from New Amsterdam attack and kill approximately 700 Native people in what becomes known as the Pound Ridge Massacre in effort to force out these communities.

      <description>Lunaapeew encounter Europeans around 1524, when Giovanni de Verrazano, an Italian, explores Lunaapahkiing. In 1609, Lunaapeew encounter Henry Hudson and his Dutch ship the Half Moon. Financed by the Dutch East India Company, Hudson claims lands along Muhheakantuck River (later named the Hudson). He reports meeting Lunaapeew along the west shore.
