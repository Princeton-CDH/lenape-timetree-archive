      <description>The Munsee Three Sisters Farm is created to rebuild community and well-being among Munsee Ramapough clans after centuries of colonial violence, beginning with the Ramapough massacre in 1644 and continuing through a century of state-sanctioned industrial poisoning. The Turtle Clan, for instance, has lived for 56 years in a federal superfund site. The farm cultivates healthy traditionally grown food for distribution at no cost to the community while also earning a profit.</description>

Beginning with the Manhattan Project, it locates the histories of toxic environmental racism and the contemporary technoscientific management of U.S. national security.</description>
