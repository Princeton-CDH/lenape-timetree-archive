      <description>Willim Penn hopes to make a profit from purchasing and selling lands and by collecting taxes. Yet his Quaker values oblige him to treat Lunaapeew equally. He demands of his fellow Quakers that “no man shall … in word or deed, affront or wrong any Indian.”</description>

      <description>By the early 1600s, Lunaapeew have lived along Lenapewihittuck and its tributaries for millennia. Lenapewihittuck means “rapid stream of the Lunaape.” English settlers name it the “Delaware” after Lord de la Warr III, governor of the Virginia colony. Later, settlers refer to both the Munsee and the Unami Lenape as the “Delaware&amp;quot; – people of Lenapewihittuck.

      <description>Dutch explorers establish trade with Lunaapeew in the early 1610s and then build settlements on both sides of Lenapewihittuck (the Delaware) in the 1620s. Lunaape homelands are increasingly populated with Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English settlers. They use Lunaape trails to explore the land and transport resources. They also introduce diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza that would devastate many Indigenous nations.

      <description>According to legend, William Penn enters into a treaty with Lunaapeew in 1682. The Treaty of Shackamaxon is signed under an elm tree in a sacred Lunaape area known as Shackamaxon, which is north of Philadelphia and along the Lenapewihittuck/Delaware River. Penn signs agreements with Lunaapeew that bring lands deeded to him under his absolute title, while still recognizing and reserving certain lands for Lunaapeew where their villages are located.</description>

      <description>In 1682, William Penn lands in the “Delaware Bay” on a ship bearing smallpox pathogens. By then, the land has been designated as William Penn’s by English King Charles II to resolve an enormous debt to Penn’s father. Penn already holds lands in West and East New Jersey. Approximately 1,750 British Quakers now live in West New Jersey.
