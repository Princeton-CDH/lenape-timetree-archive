      <description>Thanks mainly to the donation and fund-raising work of Nathaniel FitzRandolph—son of an “original Quaker settler”–Princeton outbids New Brunswick for 1,700 New Jersey pounds in funding, ten acres of “cleared” land for the campus, and 200 acres of woodland for fuel. FitzRandolph alone donates 4.5 acres. There is no recorded consultation between Nathaniel FitzRandolph’s ancestors and the Lunaapeew. Likewise, there is no mention of the Lunaapeew in the documents detailing the enormous “land donation” from the people of Princeton to the College of New Jersey in the mid-1700s.</description>

      <description>Lunaapeew encounter Europeans around 1524, when Giovanni de Verrazano, an Italian, explores Lunaapahkiing. In 1609, Lunaapeew encounter Henry Hudson and his Dutch ship the Half Moon. Financed by the Dutch East India Company, Hudson claims lands along Muhheakantuck River (later named the Hudson). He reports meeting Lunaapeew along the west shore.

      <description>Not only is Thomas and John Penns&amp;rsquo; deed underlying the &amp;ldquo;Walking Purchase&amp;rdquo; itself highly suspect, but they recruit runners, not walkers, for the job of marking the extent of the purchase. Further, colonial agents clear a path for the runners in a reconnaissance of the territory beforehand. As a result, the Penn brothers seize 750,000 acres of Lunaape land.

      <description>By the 1730s, William Penn’s sons – Thomas and John – realize that Lunaape land could be used to resolve their great debts. With the help of a co-conspirator, John Logan, they produce an unsigned draft deed from 1686 in which Lunaapeew ostensibly promise to give up as much land as can be covered in a day and a half’s walk westward from the Delaware River in Bucks County.
Passage written in 1851 by Francis Parkman describing the Walking Purchase.</description>

      <description>In 1682, William Penn lands in the “Delaware Bay” on a ship bearing smallpox pathogens. By then, the land has been designated as William Penn’s by English King Charles II to resolve an enormous debt to Penn’s father. Penn already holds lands in West and East New Jersey. Approximately 1,750 British Quakers now live in West New Jersey.
