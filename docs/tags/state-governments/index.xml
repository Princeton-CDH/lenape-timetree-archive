      <description>New Jersey officially recognizes the stateâ€™s Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation and its hometown in Bridgeton (86 miles from Princeton; first European settlement in 1686). (After a federal lawsuit on the part of the tribe, the state officially re-recognizes the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape as a tribe in 2018.) The Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Office in Bridgeton has said there are more than 12,000 members of the Lenape Tribe in the surrounding region. Held until 2019, the annual two-day pow-wow hosts members of tribal nations across the United States and received about 10,000 spectators.</description>

      <description>Some Brotherton Reservation families sell their lands and move to New York State to settle among the Oneidas in Stockbridge, New York (187 miles from Princeton). A few stay behind. The New Jersey Assembly agrees in 1801 to sell the reservation and give profits to remaining tribal members.
