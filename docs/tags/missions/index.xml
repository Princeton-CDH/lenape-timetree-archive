      <description>In 1746, Presbyterian minister David Brainerd founds Bethel Indian Town, or the Bethel Mission Settlement, comprised of Lunaapeew who have converted to Christianity. Brainerd dies from tuberculosis a year later, but Bethel Mission does not disband until 1759. The Bethel site is about fifteen miles east of Princeton, in what is now Monroe Township. Brainerd is also mentor to Stephen Calvin (Lunaape), a Native translator at the Treaty of Easton; and he advocated for Stephen&amp;rsquo;s son Bartholemew Scott Calvin to matriculate at Princeton in 1774.</description>

      <description>University President Jonathan Edward&amp;rsquo;s bound beaverskin book is presented to the University Library by Mrs. William Edwards. The Hebrew Lexicon (ca. 1645) with its beaverskin binding is likely the work of Lunaapeew for missionary David Brainerd. David Brainerd was a pioneer missionary among Native peoples after being expelled from Yale for his New Light Presbyterian beliefs and comments about an impious faculty member. He founded Bethel Indian Town (ten miles from Princeton).</description>

      <description>Under the terms of the 1758 Treaty of Easton, the first Native reservation in the colonies, the Brotherton Reservation, is established near Medford Lakes, sometimes known as Indian Mills, New Jersey. Brotherton is intended to “accommodate” (or concentrate) Lunaapeew who refuse to leave their land. Missionary David Brainerd is appointed guardian of Lunaapeew now called Brotherton Indians.

      <description>Munsee converts from Pennsylvania follow Moravian missionary David Zeisberger to eastern Ohio, where he founds several Native Moravian villages. The British arrest him during the Revolutionary War under suspicion of helping the Patriots. While under arrest at Fort Detroit, nearly one hundred of his Native American followers are murdered in what is memorialized as the Gnadenhutten Massacre. This leads to the Moravian Delaware migration.

      <description>Around 1858, Presbyterian Reverend Dr. Sheldon Jackson graduates from the Princeton Theological Seminary (founded in 1812 by the College of New Jersey and the Presbyterian Church). For the next fifteen years, he works as a missionary for the Choctaw in Indian Territory and then in the American West. In 1877, he begins mission work in Alaska (purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867) and Siberia and is collecting cultural objects to ensure Indigenous cultural survival.</description>

      <description>Presbyterian Reverend Dr. Sheldon Jackson, a graduate from the Princeton Theological Seminary, begins to donate Native American cultural belongings mostly from Alaska, the Pacific Northwest Coast, and the Southwest to the Princeton Theological Seminary. The collection is supplemented by additional Jackson donations in 1883 and 1885.
In 1886, William Libbey (‘1877) returns from an expedition in Alaska with Yakutat Tlingit material, including materials from a shaman’s grave. In 1882, the collection is transferred to the College of New Jersey, and the Museum of Geology and Archaeology (in what is now the faculty room in Nassau Hall), and subsequently to Guyot Hall.</description>

      <description>As the sixth president of the College of New Jersey, John Witherspoon reflects on “experiment” of educating Native Americans: “On the whole it does not appear, that either by our people going among them, or by their being brought among us, that it is possible to give them a relish of civilized life. There have been some of them educated at this college, as well as in New England; but seldom if never did they ever prove good or useful.</description>
