      <description>The Munsee Lunaapeew live along the Upper Delaware, in a region called Minisink, and along Muhheakantuck, or the “Hudson.” The land that became “Princeton” is likely home to both Munsee and Unami. “Unami” is how the Munsee refer to their relatives in the south, and “Munsee” is how the Unami refer to their relatives in the north.

      <description>Lunaapeew encounter Europeans around 1524, when Giovanni de Verrazano, an Italian, explores Lunaapahkiing. In 1609, Lunaapeew encounter Henry Hudson and his Dutch ship the Half Moon. Financed by the Dutch East India Company, Hudson claims lands along Muhheakantuck River (later named the Hudson). He reports meeting Lunaapeew along the west shore.
