      <description>In 1774 Bartholomew Scott Calvin (Shawukukhkung or Wilted Grass) (Lunaape) matriculates at the College of New Jersey. His father is Stephen Calvin, Native translator at the Treaty of Easton. Missionary David Brainerd from nearby Cranbury advocates for Stephen&amp;rsquo;s admission to College President John Witherspoon and Calvin is sponsored by the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. Funds are cut off in 1776 during the Revolutionary War, and Calvin has to drop out.</description>

      <description>University President Jonathan Edward&amp;rsquo;s bound beaverskin book is presented to the University Library by Mrs. William Edwards. The Hebrew Lexicon (ca. 1645) with its beaverskin binding is likely the work of Lunaapeew for missionary David Brainerd. David Brainerd was a pioneer missionary among Native peoples after being expelled from Yale for his New Light Presbyterian beliefs and comments about an impious faculty member. He founded Bethel Indian Town (ten miles from Princeton).</description>

      <description>In 1756, the construction of Nassau Hall is completed on FitzRandolph’s 4.5 acre donation and the College of New Jersey moves from Newark to Princeton. FitzRandolph proudly records this moment in his journal on November 13 1756: “Aaron Burr, President, preached the first sermon and began the school in Princeton College.” When built, the Nassau was the largest stone buildings in the Colonies and it is most likely where the University&amp;rsquo;s earliest Native students such as Jacob Wooley boarded (in 1759).</description>

      <description>As the sixth president of the College of New Jersey, John Witherspoon reflects on “experiment” of educating Native Americans: “On the whole it does not appear, that either by our people going among them, or by their being brought among us, that it is possible to give them a relish of civilized life. There have been some of them educated at this college, as well as in New England; but seldom if never did they ever prove good or useful.</description>
