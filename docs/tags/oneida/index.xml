      <description>Brotherton Indians release statement of refusal to leave New Jersey after Oneidas in Stockbridge, New York and invite Brothertonâ€™s members to join them. By 1802, however, the 80 remaining residents successfully petition the state legislature for permission to sell their land and use the funds to move to Oneida Lake in New York.

      <description>Some Brotherton Reservation families sell their lands and move to New York State to settle among the Oneidas in Stockbridge, New York (187 miles from Princeton). A few stay behind. The New Jersey Assembly agrees in 1801 to sell the reservation and give profits to remaining tribal members.
