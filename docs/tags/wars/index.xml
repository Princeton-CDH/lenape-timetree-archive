      <description>Most New Jersey Lunaape and Lunaapeew reject the invitation from western Delawares to join them in the Ohio Valley. In the mid-late 1700s, the eve of American Revolutionary War, most Delaware groups are living along Ohio and Allegheny rivers. Pro-British Delawares live in what is today northwestern Ohio, and pro-American Delawares near the frontier city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</description>

      <description>During the Seven Years&amp;rsquo; War (1754 to 1763), Lunaapeew who have been forced into the Ohio Country (after the Walking Purchase) ally with the French.

At the signing of the Easton Treaty, the Lunaape representative Teedyuscung makes it clear that the deceit of the Walking Purchase had led Lunaapeew to fight against the British.</description>

      <description>An infamous scheme of biological warfare surrounds the Native attack on Fort Pitt during Pontiac’s Rebellion in June 1763. As tensions intensified in the months prior, the British give two Delaware dignitaries large quantities of food and “two blankets and a handkerchief out of the small pox hospital” in exchange for maintaining their trading relationship and thereby easing pressure on soldiers and civilians in the fort. It is commonly believed that these blankets carried smallpox and that the British intended to spread the disease among Native populations by gifting them.</description>
