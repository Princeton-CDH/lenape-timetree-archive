      <description>Following the Delaware Treaty, the Delaware Tribe purchases a 10-by-30 mile tract of land from the Cherokee Nation situated along the upper Caney River Valley (Kènii Sipu, around the Oklahoma-Kansas border). Delaware chief John Conner writes to Cherokee Chief William P. Ross (1842 Princeton alum) confirming the sale and stating his choice of the “preservation” over “incorporation” option, consistent with the 1866 U.S. Treaty with the Cherokee of 1866. The Delaware Tribe preserves its tribal integrity, vouching to maintain tribal organization in ways not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee.</description>

      <description>During the Seven Years&amp;rsquo; War (1754 to 1763), Lunaapeew who have been forced into the Ohio Country (after the Walking Purchase) ally with the French. British colonial governors introduce the 1758 Treaty of Easton to Lunaapeew and other Native nations. The last of Lunaape land in New Jersey is “ceded” for $1,000 Spanish dollars.
At the signing of the Easton Treaty, the Lunaape representative Teedyuscung makes it clear that the deceit of the Walking Purchase had led Lunaapeew to fight against the British.</description>

      <description>In the 1794 Jay Treaty between Britain and the United States, Britain withdraws their association with Native Americans south of Canada, weakening the position of pro-British Native Americans in the United States. Months later, the Delaware and several nations sign the Treaty of Greenville with the colonial Americans. For an annuity of approximately $9,500 they “cede” all but a patch of Ohio land, which the United States retains the right to purchase.</description>

      <description>By the 1730s, William Penn’s sons – Thomas and John – realize that Lunaape land could be used to resolve their great debts. With the help of a co-conspirator, John Logan, they produce an unsigned draft deed from 1686 in which Lunaapeew ostensibly promise to give up as much land as can be covered in a day and a half’s walk westward from the Delaware River in Bucks County.
Passage written in 1851 by Francis Parkman describing the Walking Purchase.</description>
