      &#34;text&#34;: &#34;Following the Civil War, the Delaware continue to suffer under the pressure of increasing white settlement. The U.S. Government signs a final treaty with the Delaware Tribe, the 1866 Delaware Treaty. The Delaware Council “gives up” their reservation in Kansas and relocates to Indian Territory. Just under 1,000 Delaware remove to the Cherokee Nation at an area equal to 160 acres a person. The Delaware purchase a 10-by-30 mile tract of land from the Cherokee Nation situated along the upper Caney River valley (Oklahoma-Kansas today). In 1866, Delaware Chief John Conner writes to Cherokee Chief William P. Ross (Princeton alum) confirming the sale and stating his choice of the “preservation” over “incorporation” option, consistent with 1866 U.S Treaty with the Cherokee. The Delaware Tribe of Indians maintains tribal integrity, vouching to preserve tribal organization in ways not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee.\nWalter S. Logan, reprinted by Richard C. AdamsLibrary of Congress See the 1866 Delaware Treaty.\n&#34;,

British colonial governors introduce the 1758 Treaty of Easton to Lunaapeew and other Native nations. The last of Lunaape land in New Jersey is “ceded” for $1,000 Spanish dollars.\nAt the signing of the Easton Treaty, the Lunaape representative Teedyuscung makes it clear that the deceit of the Walking Purchase had led Lunaapeew to fight against the British. Native chiefs exact a promise from the British to recognize Indigenous fishing and hunting rights, and, in exchange, Native nations vouch not to ally with the French. The British do not keep their promise to protect usufructuary rights.\nAmong the Lunaape translators at the 1758 Treaty of Easton is a person titled, “Interpreter of the Delaware and Minisink Languages,” and named Stephen Calvin. Steven is father to Princeton student Shawuskukhkung (\u0026ldquo;Wilted Grass\u0026rdquo;), otherwise known as Bartholomew Calvin.

      &#34;text&#34;: &#34;Melissa Moreton, Caitlin Rizzo, and Suzanne Conklin Akbari describe the Munsee Names Project as “an Indigenous-led effort to support rediscovery and reclamation of the names of historical Munsee peoples - names and histories that have largely been lost, erased, or presented through the perspective of non-Indigenous peoples across the historical record.” The project began in November 2021 under Mark Peters (historian, knowledge keeper, and member of the Munsee Delaware Nation in Ontario), in collaboration with scholars and archivists at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. The Ontario communities of the Thames River (today the Munsee-Delaware Nation centered in Muncey, and Eelünaapéewi Lahkéewiit in Moraviantown, Ontario) are part of the larger diasporic community of Lunaape peoples. The aim of the Munsee Names Project is to build a dataset of names of Munsee-Delaware community members from key historical documents, for use by present-day Munsee peoples, beginning with an 1829 Census made by colonial settlers documenting the names of “Munsee Indians” living in two villages (a small “Upper Village” and a larger “Lower Village”) located “on the flats of the River Thames in the Township of Carradoc” in present-day Ontario. The project builds on this foundational document, working to recover names from the earlier, pre-1829 period, and forward (drawing on Greg Curnoe’s massive archival compendium DEEDS/ NATIONS which includes hundreds of 19th-century names and biographical references).\nThe goals of the project are multifaceted, drawing on the past and looking to the future. They are to:\ntranscribe the names of early community members as a way to begin to reclaim the earliest recorded histories of the community create a foundational dataset of names to use in future research into historical documents and narratives recover the names of historical Munsee peoples for use by name-givers in the present-day community” &#34;,

In 1877, he begins mission work in Alaska (purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867) and Siberia and is collecting cultural objects to ensure Indigenous cultural survival. He collects Native cultural belongings with the hope of preserving Indigenous cultures that he mistakenly believes are going extinct. In reality, his actions are harmful to Native communities who are separated from their cultural beings and belongings. In 1879, he establishes the notorious Carlisle Indian Industrial School, an Indian boarding school in Pennsylvania, 160 miles from Princeton.\n&#34;,

      &#34;text&#34;: &#34;The history of the Sand Hill Indians who live on the northern shores of Monmouth County, New Jersey, can be traced back to the eighteenth century. Lunaape communities had lived in the area for centuries, when a Cherokee family named the Richardsons left their Georgia homelands in the late eighteenth century for New York and New Jersey to live alongside their Lunaape cousins, the Reveys. After living in Eatontown, New Jersey, for over thirty years, Isaac and Elizabeth Richardson move their family to Asbury Park in 1877. The family becomes known as the “Sand Hill Indians” after the hill on their 20-acre property. Sand Hill families grow in number with each generation, and many continue to live in the area today.\nRead more on the history of the Sand Hill Indians; see a deed transferring Tinton Falls land in the ancestral territory of the Sand Hill Indians.\n&#34;,

      &#34;text&#34;: &#34;An infamous scheme of biological warfare surrounds the Native attack on Fort Pitt during Pontiac’s Rebellion in June 1763. As tensions intensified in the months prior, the British give two Delaware dignitaries large quantities of food and “two blankets and a handkerchief out of the small pox hospital” in exchange for maintaining their trading relationship and thereby easing pressure on soldiers and civilians in the fort. It is commonly believed that these blankets carried smallpox and that the British intended to spread the disease among Native populations by gifting them. Historians now debate whether this particular exchange could have been part of such a scheme.\nView a drawn map of Fort Pitt.\n&#34;,

      &#34;text&#34;: &#34;In 1682, William Penn lands in the “Delaware Bay” on a ship bearing smallpox pathogens. By then, the land has been designated as William Penn’s by English King Charles II to resolve an enormous debt to Penn’s father. Penn already holds lands in West and East New Jersey. Approximately 1,750 British Quakers now live in West New Jersey.\nView a depiction of William Penn.\n&#34;,

His uncle and prominent Cherokee statesman Chief John Ross funded William\u0026rsquo;s education. William is a slave-holder who defends the generous treatment of slaves and serves as a Confederate officer and diplomat during the Civil War. He is elected to succeed his uncle as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation in 1866, after the Civil War.\nAlternate depiction: Painting of William Potter Ross from circa 1871 - 1875.\n&#34;,

      &#34;text&#34;: &#34;As the sixth president of the College of New Jersey, John Witherspoon reflects on “experiment” of educating Native Americans: “On the whole it does not appear, that either by our people going among them, or by their being brought among us, that it is possible to give them a relish of civilized life. There have been some of them educated at this college, as well as in New England; but seldom if never did they ever prove good or useful.” Although Witherspoon held slaves, he supported their Christian instruction and education and tutored two free African men.\n&#34;,
