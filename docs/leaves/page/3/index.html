      Munsee language teachers organize a Delaware (Lunaape) language camp with Princeton and IAS faculty. The gathering includes teachers from all of the Munsee-speaking nations, along with young adult community members who may become future teachers. The schedule includes traditional land-based learning, including time at the Seed Farm located in Princeton (which is a collaborative partnership with Ramapough Lunaape Nation members), as well as a half-day journey on the Millstone River, sharing Lunaape language, local history, and discussions of Indigenous sovereignty in today’s world.

      In 1624, the Dutch colonize the southern tip of Manhattan Island and establish a trading post, which becomes New Amsterdam, and later, New York City. The fur trade booms. Manhattan, or Mannahatta, is a Munsee Lunaape word for the “bow-gathering place.”

    <div>
      Munsee converts from Pennsylvania follow Moravian missionary David Zeisberger to eastern Ohio, where he founds several Native Moravian villages. The British arrest him during the Revolutionary War under suspicion of helping the Patriots. While under arrest at Fort Detroit, nearly one hundred of his Native American followers are murdered in what is memorialized as the Gnadenhutten Massacre. This leads to the Moravian Delaware migration.

      Mark Peters, Munsee–Delaware Nation member who served his people in many different roles, was a dedicated historian who shared his knowledge within the community and far beyond, both through his travels and through online video lectures. Those at Princeton will long remember his time on Lunaapahkiing, along with his daughter Katelyn, for the inaugural Munsee Language and History Symposium in November 2021. Together with Ian McCallum, he spent time with Lunaape language items and Munsee land documents at Firestone Library&rsquo;s Special Collections.

      The Munsee Lunaapeew live along the Upper Delaware, in a region called Minisink, and along Muhheakantuck, or the “Hudson.” The land that became “Princeton” is likely home to both Munsee and Unami. “Unami” is how the Munsee refer to their relatives in the south, and “Munsee” is how the Unami refer to their relatives in the north.

      Small groups of Christian Munsee and Unami converts remaining along the Hudson and Delaware River valleys relocate with Munsee and Mahicans living in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to a reservation in Wisconsin. They are recognized today as Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians. Among those who moved to Wisconsin was Bartholemew Calvin who matriculated at the College of New Jersey in 1774.

      The Munsee Three Sisters Farm is created to rebuild community and well-being among Munsee Ramapough clans after centuries of colonial violence, beginning with the Ramapough massacre in 1644 and continuing through a century of state-sanctioned industrial poisoning. The Turtle Clan, for instance, has lived for 56 years in a federal superfund site. The farm cultivates healthy traditionally grown food for distribution at no cost to the community while also earning a profit.

      New Jersey officially recognizes the state’s Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation and its hometown in Bridgeton (86 miles from Princeton; first European settlement in 1686). (After a federal lawsuit on the part of the tribe, the state officially re-recognizes the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape as a tribe in 2018.) The Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Office in Bridgeton has said there are more than 12,000 members of the Lenape Tribe in the surrounding region. Held until 2019, the annual two-day pow-wow hosts members of tribal nations across the United States and received about 10,000 spectators.

    <div>
      In 1756, the construction of Nassau Hall is completed on FitzRandolph’s 4.5 acre donation and the College of New Jersey moves from Newark to Princeton. FitzRandolph proudly records this moment in his journal on November 13 1756: “Aaron Burr, President, preached the first sermon and began the school in Princeton College.” When built, the Nassau was the largest stone buildings in the Colonies and it is most likely where the University&rsquo;s earliest Native students such as Jacob Wooley boarded (in 1759).

      During the surge of the American Indian Movement in the early 1970s, Princeton hosts the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars in March. Professor Alfonso Ortiz (Tewa) of Anthropology chairs the event. Considered by some to be the starting point for Native American Studies, a resolution by Native scholars called for an academic discipline that included Indian ways of knowing left out of European-American education.

      Hopi student Victor Masayesva, Jr. writes a senior thesis on “Hopi Oral Tradition,” despite his resistance to writing in languages other than Hopi. He returns to his community after graduate school (University of Arizona), where he begins to create an award-winning body of work of oral histories, photography, and documentary films. Using these expressive forms, he develops a form of poetic image-making based in Native American philosophies and practices and made in the lands where they originate.
