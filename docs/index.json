      "text": "Following the Civil War, the Delaware continue to suffer under the pressure of increasing white settlement. The U.S. Government signs a final treaty with the Delaware Tribe, the 1866 Delaware Treaty. The Delaware Council “gives up” their reservation in Kansas and relocates to Indian Territory. Just under 1,000 Delaware remove to the Cherokee Nation at an area equal to 160 acres a person. The Delaware purchase a 10-by-30 mile tract of land from the Cherokee Nation situated along the upper Caney River valley (Oklahoma-Kansas today). In 1866, Delaware Chief John Conner writes to Cherokee Chief William P. Ross (Princeton alum) confirming the sale and stating his choice of the “preservation” over “incorporation” option, consistent with 1866 U.S Treaty with the Cherokee. The Delaware Tribe of Indians maintains tribal integrity, vouching to preserve tribal organization in ways not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee.\nWalter S.

The Ontario communities of the Thames River (today the Munsee-Delaware Nation centered in Muncey, and Eelünaapéewi Lahkéewiit in Moraviantown, Ontario) are part of the larger diasporic community of Lunaape peoples. The aim of the Munsee Names Project is to build a dataset of names of Munsee-Delaware community members from key historical documents, for use by present-day Munsee peoples, beginning with an 1829 Census made by colonial settlers documenting the names of “Munsee Indians” living in two villages (a small “Upper Village” and a larger “Lower Village”) located “on the flats of the River Thames in the Township of Carradoc” in present-day Ontario. The project builds on this foundational document, working to recover names from the earlier, pre-1829 period, and forward (drawing on Greg Curnoe’s massive archival compendium DEEDS/ NATIONS which includes hundreds of 19th-century names and biographical references).\nThe goals of the project are multifaceted, drawing on the past and looking to the future. They are to:\ntranscribe the names of early community members as a way to begin to reclaim the earliest recorded histories of the community create a foundational dataset of names to use in future research into historical documents and narratives recover the names of historical Munsee peoples for use by name-givers in the present-day community” ",
